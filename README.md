# QXQ_transpiler_benchmarking
Transpiler Benchmarking Tool preset optimization levels

# With our benchmarking suite we aim to test #
  1. Circuit Depth --> **Changed to Ratio of Multi-Qubit and Single Qubit Gates**
  2. Runtime of Transplier (Integrated)
  3. Number of Gates (Integrated)
  4. Number of Entangled Gates (Integrated)
  5. Circuit Fidelity (Future Work)

# Example of Circuits Tested in Sample Data: #
1. DJ (add full name)
2. Grover's Algo
3. Bernstein Varzani (check Spelling)
4. Quantum Volume

# Required Packages: #
1. Refer to setupcfg file to install all required packages
   Youtube Link for directions: (Need to add this)

# Directions To Use: #
1. Install all required packages
2. Be sure you are capturing data in ideal format (ex. lvl 1 vs lvl 3)
3. Edit code to test circuit, refer to examples to see how we add circuits
4. Capture csv, and graphs

# Future Directions: #
1. Develop the Benchmarking qualities such as circuit fidelity
3. Test different types of circuits
4. Optimize transplier using benchmarking tool
